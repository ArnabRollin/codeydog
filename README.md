# CodeyDog
A simple tool installer with the advantages of activating and deactivating

Examples:

```console
% codeydog install task # Please use `echo 'export PATH=\"{}:${{PATH}}\"' >> [your_config_file]` and reload your terminal to add it to the PATH if not already done. (Replace [your_config_file] with your config file e.g. `.zshrc`
% codeydog activate task
% task # Works now!
```
